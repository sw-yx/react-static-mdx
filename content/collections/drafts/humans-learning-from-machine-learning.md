Human Learning differs from Machine Learning in important ways.

However, there are useful things we can take from ML

- the alpha parameter
- momentum: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#Momentum
- optimality in the face of an impossibly large search space <- needed this source
- generalize > memorize by using a testing set
- epsilon exhaustion and Probably Approximately Correct learning
- naive bayes - how can it be right
  - So you just need to be directionally correct.
- random restart hill climbing
  - if theres a v specific point that is superbly better than others, you're in a bad world
- simulated annealing - hot and cold

- convert definites to maximum likelihood/probability densitiy estimation?
- transfer learning as a bootstrap -> genetic evolution?
- eager learning vs lazy learning
