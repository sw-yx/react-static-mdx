desc: better intelligence behind oclif
description: Oclif does a lot of nice things, like offering flag and argument parsing, help documentation, and pluggability. That's good for the CLI developer. But what about the CLI user? Instead of viewing our CLI's as simple harnesses for procedure calls, how can we add an intelligent layer to interpret to user intent and guide them down a pit of success? How can we make our CLI's improve using information gained over time?

Pitch:

I was the primary CLI dev for the Netlify Dev launch, and we found several user pain points that resulted in forming this thesis around needing an intelligent layer sitting behind Oclif for better UX (and DX for that UX).
