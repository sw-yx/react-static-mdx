desc: Cloning the React Hooks API in raw JS
description: The design of React Hooks requires a good understanding of closures in JavaScript. In this talk, we’ll reintroduce closures by building a tiny clone of React! This will serve two purposes – to demonstrate the effective use of closures, and to show how you can build a Hooks clone in just 29 lines of readable JS. Finally, we arrive at how you get Custom Hooks and the Rules of Hooks out of this incredible mental model!
