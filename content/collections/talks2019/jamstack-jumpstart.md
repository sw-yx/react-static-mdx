## final copy

There is a lot of developer and investment interest in JAMStack technologies, from the serverless movement to new authentication models to continuous atomic deployment to the static site generator renaissance. But with so many new terms and options, it is hard for people to figure out where to start.

This workshop will teach developers to set up a simple but state of the art Gatsby stack, which lets people create blazing fast sites and apps with React and GraphQL, backed up by a continuous deployment and serverless platform complete with authentication and CMS. It has never been easier to get a great Lighthouse score, or to deploy complex, secure webapps for free.

Requirements:
Attendees should have git, Node.js and npm installed, and be proficient with JavaScript and React (including routing with @reach/router or react-router).
Install the Gatsby CLI's ahead of time: `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
You do not need to know GraphQL, but you can get a head start by reading <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://graphql.org/learn/</a> and going through the Fundamentals section of <a href="https://www.howtographql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.howtographql.com/</a>.

## Description

## I'm the best person to speak on this subject because I have been heavily involved in the JAMstack ecosystem for years and regularly write and teach about this topic. I wrote this post https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-12-17-turning-the-static-dynamic/ for the Gatsby Blog and it was one of their most popular ever, indicating a lot of interest in a "full stack" instruction for turning static sites into fully capable web apps. I also work at Netlify and was the lead dev on the Netlify Dev CLI and can explain all the details about how to get effective at serverless functions and deployment! All technologies used in this workshop are in-demand and open source.

> Hi Organizers! I'd love a chance to lead a workshop for your folks on React, Gatsby, and serverless authentication and function execution. I believe many attendees will have passing familiarity with them but don't use them in their day jobs, and would like to attend a session to ramp up on this. I would love to be their guide.

## instructions

We appreciate you submitting your workshop or lectures here to help us keep things organised. We'll do our best to make it a big family like experience during the event, so you can just feel comfortable.

We will assign your workshop to be held in the afternoon from 1pm till 4:30pm on one of the 3 conference days 14-16th of June 2019 at the LASALLE College of the Arts at 1 McNally St. All JSConf.Asia attendees can choose one workshop to attend per day on a first come, first serve basis before the event. That means: You'll inevitibly be competing with our attendees natural desire to simply sip cocktails in our green lounge. So better make your session an interesting one. ;)

Here are 3 things you want to avoid in your workshop:

- Sales pitches or promotions for yourself or your products, services or employment
- Overly simple getting started on X sessions.
- Requiring deep knowledge or usage of proprietary software or platforms

And here are a few things we want to encourage:

- Provide clear instructions for participants to prepare for the workshop below
- Assume an audience that has already significant experience with web technologies, but potentially no knowledge of the workshop topic
- Clear step-by-step introduction on getting started during the session. Start with a summary of what is going to happen.
- Plan for some time in which your participants can experiment
- Leave creative room in what or how participants should solve something. E.g. Begin a story, let them finish it.
- Allow participants to share, build upon ideas and ultimately have fun!

The good people of engineers.sg might record your workshop and upload it after the event. Let us know if you'd like to opt out.

And don't forget: There's always our code of conduct. In short: Be a respectful, loving person!
