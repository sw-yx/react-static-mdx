He used freeCodeCamp and a ton of other resources, and since then he's worked as a freelance developer, and at several companies including Netlify.</p><p>It's a 2 hour listen in your favorite podcast player app - just search "freecodecamp" and you should find it. </p><p>If you have an Amazon Echo, you can just say "Alexa - play the freeCodeCamp podcast."</p><p>Or you can listen to it or <a href="http://podcast.freecodecamp.org/ep-59-shawn-wang-left-a-350kyear-finance-job-to-learn-to-code">right here in your browser</a>.
